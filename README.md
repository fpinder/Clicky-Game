**Object**

*The Application [Clicky-Game](https://radiant-peak-47487.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku is created has a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Therefore, the application follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route the data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. Buger `Eat-Da-Burger!` is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page `waiting to be devoured.` Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour it! button`. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.*
